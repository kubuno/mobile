/**

 * by the whole app, which with several accounts live at once would let a
 * request leave for one server carrying another's bearer — a cross-instance
 * leak, not merely a stale read. One client per account removes the question.
 *
 * Connection pool and dispatcher are injected so that N accounts share one set
 * of sockets and threads instead of N.
